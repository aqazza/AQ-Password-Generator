# Password Generator Starter Code

This Challenge and Application was made in reason to be used by the user to generate a password with random numbers, characters, and uppercase/lowercase letters. It allows the user to generate a password with various options that they desire such as whether they want to use uppercase and lowercase letters and whether the password will include numerical and special characters. The application runs in the browser and will have a polished and responsive interface.
